## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I learned there is a thing that's called a viewport. I learned that you can style body the same way you stile a div.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6654958/make-body-have-100-of-the-browser-height) - This helped me to set body height to the height of the viewport.
